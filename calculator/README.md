# Simple Calculator in Python

## Overview
This Python program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a part of my Python learning journey as I explore the world of Python programming.

## Features
- **User-Friendly:** The program takes user inputs directly in the console, making it easy to interact with and obtain results in real-time.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
- **Error Handling:** The calculator handles errors gracefully, including checking for division by zero and invalid inputs.

## Learning Insights
As I transitioned from JavaScript to Python, I found several similarities between the two languages, making the learning process smoother. However, Python introduced me to different variable types, such as floats and ints.

One of the most satisfying aspects of working with Python was its straightforward approach to user inputs and immediate feedback. It's a remarkable experience to see the program's functionality unfold in real-time.

Moreover, Python pleasantly surprised me with constructs like f-strings for string formatting, which felt familiar yet slightly different from what I was used to in JavaScript.

This project reaffirms the versatility of programming languages and their unique problem-solving capabilities. Learning Python has been an exciting step in my coding journey, and I look forward to exploring more of its capabilities.

## Usage
1. Run the program by executing the `calculator.py` file.
2. Enter the first number, an operator (+, -, *, /), and the second number when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the result.
4. Enjoy experimenting with basic arithmetic operations!

Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvements. Happy calculating! üßÆüêç
