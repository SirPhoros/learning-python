# Tic-Tac-Toe Python Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Python game! In this project, I've explored Python classes and implemented a classic game that most of us have played on a piece of paper. üöÄüêç

## Python Classes and Game Logic

- **Python Classes:** This project showcases the use of Python classes to model the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. We've created three classes: `Player`, `RandomComputerPlayer`, and `HumanPlayer`. These classes effectively manage player moves and the game's logic.

- **Game Logic:** The heart of the game resides in the `TicTacToe` class. It maintains the game's state, checks for a winner, and ensures valid moves. The board is represented as a list, and we track the current winner as the game progresses.

- **User Interface:** The game's user interface is simple yet functional. Players can make moves by entering numbers corresponding to the board positions. We also added some pauses between moves to simulate the turns and enhance the user experience.

## Learning Python Insights

During this project, I've gained valuable insights into Python programming:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Building classes and using inheritance (e.g., `Player` and its subclasses) offers a structured and organized way to manage complex projects.

- **User Input Handling:** Implementing user input validation and error handling (in the `HumanPlayer` class) ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Game Logic:** Developing game logic and rules is a fundamental aspect of programming. In Tic-Tac-Toe, we check for winning conditions in rows, columns, and diagonals.

## Usage

1. Run the `tic-tac-toe.py` file to start the game.
2. Players take turns making moves by entering numbers (0-8) corresponding to the board positions.
3. The game ends when a player wins or it's a tie.
4. Enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe and challenge your friends!
