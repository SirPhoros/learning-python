# Learning Python

## Introduction
After gaining proficiency in JavaScript, I am now embarking on a new learning adventure with Python. Python's versatility and wide-ranging applications, including data science, cybersecurity, DevOps, and machine learning, have piqued my curiosity, driving my motivation to dive into this dynamic language.

## Projects
Here's a list of the Python projects and games I've completed as part of my learning journey:

1. **Calculator:** A basic calculator program designed to perform fundamental mathematical operations.

2. **Guess the Number (User vs. Computer):** Two variations of the classic number-guessing game. In one version, the user guesses the number, while in the other, the computer takes on the guessing challenge.

3. **Hangman Game:** A classic word-guessing game where players attempt to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters.

I'll be continually updating this repository with new projects, challenges, and insights gained from my Python learning journey. Stay tuned for more exciting Python adventures!

Feel free to explore my projects, offer feedback, or even collaborate. I'm open to suggestions and eager to connect with fellow Python enthusiasts.

Happy coding! üêç
